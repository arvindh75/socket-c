##Instructions
- Un-tar the downloaded folder 
- Switch to the directory using
```C
cd 2019111010
```
- Run make

```
make
```

-  Clients files are present inside ``client_dir`` and Server files are present under ``server_dir``
- Server can be turned on by running 
```
./server_dir/server
```
- Client can be turned on by running 
```
./client_dir/client
```
- Client can get data using
```
get <filename1> <filename2>
```

```
exit
```
- Multiple clients can obtain data from a single server but one by one.
- The code flow is pretty much straightforward.
